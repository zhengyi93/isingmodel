Project C: The Ising Model of a Ferromagnet

Part II Physics Computation Project
- Sample animation and visualization code are uploaded here.

movies.py is a standalone file that generates a movie of a NxN Ising ferromagnet. 

Change the following values if desired before running movies.py:
- N: Lattice size 
- T: Temperature of the canonical ensemble
- H: Strength of external magnetic field
- state: Initial state of the ferromagnet
